# QTasks/GTasks

This is a work-in-progress. Documentation will come soon.

### A soon-to-be Google Tasks wrapper and Library

## Requirements
 - python
 - google-auth
 - google-auth-oauthlib
 - google-api-core
 - google-api-python-client

## Virtualenv

 - Created via [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#env).
 - Python binary is (usually) in `.venv/bin/python`
 - You can enable with `source venv/bin/activate` and disable with `deactivate`

## Unsupported Python Versions
Google's API requires python >=3.6, so anything less won't work. I have to check which dependencies for a final answer.

## License
